# Objectives

<div class="jumbotron text-left">

You will need to create an app that can display and manage a list of dogs.

You will need to have two screens, one to display the list of `Dog` items, the other to edit or add a `Dog` item.

The `Dog` class will need to have the following properties:

 - `name`: a string for the dog's name
 - `breed`: a string for the dog's breed
 - `subBreed`: an **optional** sub-breed for the dog

</div>
